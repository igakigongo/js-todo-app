# Todo App

  The top level goal is to design a web application that manages a user's todo items. 

  The main focus is to demonstrate developer's ability to 
  - Organize a JavaScript code base 
  - Use and understand JavaScript patterns such as constructor, factory and module
  - Use a modern bundler such as React to manage static assets (css/js/images)
  - Use vanilla Javascript to achieve the above tasks
  - Understand new JavaScript language features (ECMAScript 6 and beyond)
  - Use Linters to follow coding styles (both on local machines and on GitHub)

To begin customizing the software from an IDE follow these steps:

First Run in the project root folder
